In this program, the user is prompted to enter a year. The program then uses a series of if statements to check if the year is divisible by 4, 100, and 400. If the year is divisible by 4 but not by 100, it is a leap year. If the year is divisible by 100 but not by 400, it is not a leap year. If the year is divisible by 400, it is a leap year. The program then displays a message indicating whether the year is a leap year or not.
